  abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of energy constrained gait optimization
	for bipedal walking. We present a solution to this problem obtained
	by applying a recently introduced heuristic method, the Al- liance
	Algorithm (AA), and compare its performance against a Genetic Algorithm
	(GA). We show experimentally that the intrinsic ability of the AA
	to handle hard constraints enables it to find solutions signifi-
	cantly better than the GA. Also with the constraint removed the AA
	show more reliable optimization results. Finally, we show that the
	final gait obtained through this method outperforms most solutions
	to this problem presented in previous works, in terms of walking
	speed.},
