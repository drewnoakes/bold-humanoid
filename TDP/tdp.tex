  In this paper we describe the RoboCup Humanoid Kid Size section of
  team Bold Hearts, the RoboCup team of the University of
  Hertfordshire, in Hatfield UK. As a team that is well experienced in
  the 3D Soccer Simulation, we focus on combining our efforts in both
  teams, by sharing frameworks and experience between both.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Team Bold Hearts, representing the University of Hertfordshire in
Hatfield, UK, is committed to participate in the 2013 RoboCup Humanoid
League, Kid Size championship in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. The team
was founded in 2002, competing in both the 2D and 3D RoboCup Simulation
Leagues. After a short hiatus, a full restart of the team was initiated.
As listed below, this resulted in several successful years with a number
of rewards.

The team consists of members with a wide range of experience, from
first year undergraduate students to master students, PhD
students, professional developers from industry and university
staff.

Team Bold Hearts has a long history within the 3D simulation league, competing
in thirteen events since 2009, placing in the top four in all but one.
Two of our team members have served on the technical committee, and one as
the organising chair in both a regional and world cup competition.
All team members participate voluntarily on an extra-curricular basis.

The main goals of our team are twofold: firstly, to provide a
valuable source of experience, contacts, and enjoyment.
Secondly, to use the robotic football scenario as an important
test bed for several of our ongoing research projects.

In the rest of this paper we go into these aspects more
deeply. Finally, team Bold Hearts commits to supplying at least one
team member with enough knowledge of the Humanoid Kid Size rules to
perform as referee during the competitions.

\section{Simulation \& Hardware, Joint Opportunities}
\label{sec:simul-amp-hardw}

To the best of our knowledge team Bold Hearts is currently the only team
working on both Soccer Simulation and Kid Size challenges.

In previous years, SimSpark, the 3D simulator, has been used to model
a replica of the Nao robot from the Standard Platform League. 2013
promises to be the first year in which heterogeneous robot models
will be used during competitions.

As we work to bring the capabilities of our 3D team to physical robots,
we are undertaking the expansion of our codebase to cover multiple diverse platforms.
We have found the rapid prototyping of ideas and automation of learning algorithms and
optimisation that the simulator afford very valuable and are working
to utilise such techniques within the Kid Size league.

We also have considerable experience of developing the
3D simulator itself, including RoboCup Federation-funded
project work. We are learning more about the challenges physical
robots pose, and will strive to use this knowledge to improve the
capability and fidelity of the simulation where it makes sense to do so.

Each league has much to offer, and we are pleased to have taken a
position that spans such challenges and disciplines.

%Make an introductory case of how a cross-league effort can benefit
%all: we bring high level strategy to hardware league, and can feed
%back realism into simulation league (mention team members have been
%active in several levels of 3DSSL organization?). Note to our
%knowledge we are the first team coming from simulation league (some
%are in SPL though).

\section{Research \& Development}
\label{sec:research}

\subsection{Shared Framework}
\label{sec:framework}

Mention we use libbats: mature but actively developed open source base
framework in 3DSSL; used by several successful teams; Bold Hearts
currently main maintainers; in the process of porting to hardware, to
supply common medium level control interface (skill set framework);
challenges (and describe how we solve it): vision (well on way to have
real time high resolution solution), noise + ... observations (libbats
natively allows for different localization solutions), different +
uncertain model (again, libbats allows for this).

\subsection{Bipedal Locomotion}
\label{sec:bipedal-locomotion}

Describe inverse kinematic gait control; describe optimization in
simulation; describe energy limiting optimization + publication
\cite{lattarulo_application_2011}.
